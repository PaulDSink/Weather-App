![Example](images/)
Above is an example of the functionality of my application.

### User Stories  

* As Steve, I want to log into my profile so only I can view my list.
* As Jenny, I want to view my grocery list from my phone so I do not need to remember to bring a list to the store.
* As Dennis, I want to add items to my list when I think of them so I don't forget something while shopping.
* As Mark, I want to delete items from my list so I do not get them again the next time I am at the store.
* As Kim, I want to update my name on my profile.
* As Henry, I want to delete my account since I no longer use the application.
* As a fast shopper, I want to be able to view what area of the store each of my items are in so I don't miss an item while I am in that part of the store.
* As John, I want to create multiple groceries for different meals I plan on having so I know what to get at the store when cooking certain dishes.
* As Tonya, I want to share my list with my husband so he doesn't forget anything.
* As George, I want to be able to check off items as I put them in my cart without deleting them so I know what I have already grabbed.
